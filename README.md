# Wordfeud Solver
A Rust library to evaluate all possible moves given a wordfeud board and rack.
The wordfeud solver needs a wordlist to be able to play in a given language. There are no 
wordlists included with this library. You can get a dutch wordlist [here](https://github.com/jensanjo/wordfeud-wordlists.git).

This solver is ported from the excellent [wordfeudplayer](https://github.com/mrcz/Wordfeud-Player) Python package .
By porting it to Rust it became much faster.
